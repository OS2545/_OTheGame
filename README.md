_OTheGame is a traditional tic tac toe game with player vs AI and horror elements, which takes around a few days in development in total.

 There are 3 main rules players have to follow when playing.

1. The player must win 3 rounds of the tic-tac-toe game in a row.
2. The player must not be disabled (this comes with a tile with a body part on it. If the player crosses out the part, it means the player loses their body part and loses the game)
3. The player must have at least 1 family member left at the end of the game.
